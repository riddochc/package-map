== DESCRIPTION ==

Package-map creates a PDF visualizing package dependencies in OpenSUSE, or any
other distribution using zypper for package management.

== SYNOPSIS ==

package-map.rb <packagename>

== REQUIREMENTS ==

* Ruby.
** This was tested with 2.0.0-p389, but will probably work with 1.9.3 as well.
** Available from your built-in package manager, or http://www.ruby-lang.org/
* Graphviz.
** This was tested with version 2.28.0 (20130927.2339), should work with any recent version.
** Available from http://www.graphviz.org/
* Memoize gem.
** This was tested with a gem built from the git checkout at 'memoize-1.3.1-5-gca100ca'
** Available from https://github.com/djberg96/memoize

== INSTALL ==

No installation is necessary, the program can be used where downloaded.  Future
versions will be installable with 'gem install package-map'

== USAGE DETAILS ==

Provide the name of the package you would like to begin a search from.  This
program may take a significant amount of time to run, as a result of executing
zypper repeatedly.  Please be patient, no output will be produced on success.

Several files will be created in your current working directory, which can be
used to speed up future searches by temporarily storing results between runs
of the program.  You may freely delete these, at the cost of future runs needing
to run zypper more times, taking longer:

* providers.cache
* recursive_requirements.cache
* requirements.cache

Two more files will be created when package-map is finished running:

* <packagename>_requirements.gv
* <packagemap>_graph.pdf

The first file describes the graph to be drawn, and the pdf is the result of
running it through Graphviz.

If the graph is unusually large, you may find tulip, at http://www.tulip-software.org
to be more appropriate than Graphviz.  Tulip can import the .gv data file produced
by package-map without changes.

If you know of other graph visualization tools well-suited to consuming this data, send
me an email and I can include a reference to it in this documentation.

== CONTRIBUTING ==

This is free software!  Fork this project on Github and send a pull-request, or
email me a patch file.

I would appreciate, but don't require, joint copyright ownership of contributions.
If I accept a patch without the assignment of at least some amount of copyright,
it precludes being able to grant custom licensing as appropriate, which is one
means for developers to be fairly compensated for their work on free software.
Note that the FSF, and many non-FSF projects, require complete copyright transfer
of all contributions!
